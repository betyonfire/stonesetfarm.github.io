# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: Stoneset Farm is the home of the Rutenbeck family and our many projects. 
    Our nursery produces annual flower and vegetable seedlings. We keep a dairy
    goat herd of mixed Alpine and Oberhasli that produces milk, cheese, and
    meat. Our registered American Guinea Hog swine are available for sale as
    feeder pigs, registered breeders, or for slaughter.
