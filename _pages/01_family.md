Stoneset Farm is the home to Clara, Nathan, Eleanor, Magpie, and Matthias 
Rutenbeck, a place where we live and farm and laugh and grow together. 

Born and raised in Brooklin, Clara has been growing plants and caring for animals
since she was small. The pull to grow things continues to have ahold of her, as
evidenced by the thousands of seedlings she starts every spring, the flowers
that appear in her wake, and the goats and other animals that follow her around
the farm. 
Clara’s time at College of the Atlantic helped to articulate how she thinks
about the ways in which humans and place shape each other, and after college
she returned to her home to put that knowledge to use crafting a life here at
Stoneset Farm. 


Currently the kiddos are ages eleven, nine, and almost five, though now the 
years seem to be speeding up at an unfathomable rate and before we know it 
they will be up and off on their own adventures. They are starting to help 
with animal and garden chores more now that they’re bigger, and can often 
be found helping in the greenhouse with seedlings. Of course everyone 
loves to harvest vegetables and from the garden, even if they don’t quite 
like to eat them, and they are forever bringing in bouquets of both wild 
and cultivated flowers and offering them to us and each other.
