## OPENING SALE DATES ARE FRIDAY TO MONDAY MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND

## Seedling Sale Days are Saturdays 9 - 5 and Wednesdays 9 - 12 mid-May to end of June 

Using sustainable methods and organic potting soil, we grow annual vegetable
seedlings as well as annual, biennial, and perennial flower starts. Some people
ask why we are not certified organic, and the answer really can be distilled
down on the fact that (in her own words) paperwork is not one of Clara’s
strongest points at this moment in time, and there’s a fair amount of paperwork
to maintain certification. 

If you’re looking for plants outside of those hours, lucky for you
[Mainescape](https://www.mainescape.com/) carries the largest selection of 
our plants off the farm (thank you Althea!)
and you can also find them at the [Blue Hill Wine
Shop](http://www.bluehillwineshop.com/) at the start of the
season as well as the [Surry General Store](http://surrygeneralstore.com/). 
You can also come to the farm by arrangement. 

We always like to know what varieties worked well in your gardens and what
additional plants and varieties you’d like for us to grow. 

Please remember when you drive up to he farm that there are many small children
about.
