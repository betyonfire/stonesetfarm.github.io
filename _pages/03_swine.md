# Swine
The swine are an American heritage
breed called American Guinea hogs. The American Guinea is prized for its
thriftiness, hardiness, marbeled meat, and high quality fat. A traditional lard
pig, they were valued by homesteaders for their ability to forage and survive
on very little. Compact in size, they make a great choice for homesteaders
and permaculture systems as an added source of work (they are excellent
rooters), fertility, and food. For butchers and bakers (and probably
candlestick makers too), they have an extremely high quality fat that makes the
meat sought after for charcuterie and baking.

Currently available for sale we have:

- 3 gilts, born 2/2016
