We keep a drove of [American Guinea
hogs](https://livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/guineahog),
a heritage breed that is prized for its thriftiness, hardiness, marbeled meat,
and high quality fat. A traditional lard pig, are were valued by homesteaders
for their ability to forage and survive on very little. Compact in size, they
make a great choice for homesteaders and permaculture systems as an added
source of work (they are excellent rooters), fertility, and food. For butchers
and bakers (and probably candlestick makers too), they have an extremely high
quality fat that makes the meat sought after for charcuterie and baking. We
feed our swine mostly grass, either from pasture in the winter or hay in the
summer, along with a small supplement of high-quality grain purchased in bulk
through our local grange hall.

Currently available for sale we have:

- 3 gilts, born 2/2016
- 26 shoats, mix of gilts and barrows, born 10/2016 - 11/2016

All the swine for sale are registerable through the American Guinea Hog Association. 
If you have interest in purchasing swine for breeding or for feeder pigs, don't
hesitate to contact us.
