We keep a registered drove of [American Guinea
hogs](https://livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/guineahog),
a heritage breed that is prized for its thriftiness, hardiness, marbeled meat,
and high quality fat. They are a good fit for our small farm's rocky soils, 
and have been a big help in preparing gardens and providing fertility. A 
traditional lard breed, are were valued by homesteaders for their ability to 
forage and survive on very little. 

Though they grow slowly and to smaller size, these swine are a great choice 
for homesteads and small farms as an added source of work (they are excellent 
rooters), fertility, and food. For butchers and bakers (and probably candlestick makers too), they have an extremely high
quality fat that makes the meat sought after for charcuterie and baking. We
feed our swine mostly grass, either from pasture in the winter or hay in the
summer, along with a small supplement of high-quality grain purchased in bulk
through a local [grange hall](http://www.halcyongrange.org/).

Contact us if you are interested in purchasing piglets, shoats, or breeding
stock.
