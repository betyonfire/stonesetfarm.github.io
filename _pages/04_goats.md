We keep a herd of French Alpine and Oberhasli diary goats that we use for milk,
dairy, and meat. We make a variety of flavored fresh cheeses, from garlic and
salt to rose honey, to peppered blueberry. We also make a brined feta, French
farmhouse bloomy rind cheese similar to the [St. Maure de
Touraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Maure_de_Touraine) and
[Pouligny-Saint-Pierre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouligny-Saint-Pierre_cheese)
cheeses of the Loire Valley region of France, and a blueberry wine brushed
[Tomme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomme) style.

Please note that our milk and dairy products are not for sale, as we are not a licensed
dairy producer. Similarly, because we do our own slaughter and butchering here
on the farm rather than through a commercial slaughterhouse, our meat is not
for sale either. We do sell growing stock, however. Our herd typically kids in
March, and kids are ready for sale 8 weeks after birth.
