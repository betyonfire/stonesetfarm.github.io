# Welcome to Stoneset Farm
## Seedling Sales
We are open for seedling sales starting Wednesday, May 9, and will be open Wednesdays 10-2, and Saturdays 9-5. We will also be open Saturday, Sunday, and Monday of Memorial Day weekend. We will be at the Stonington Farmersâ€™ Market on Fridays this spring. 

## Cut-Your-Own CSA
I am growing a quarter acre of cut flowers this year and will be doing a cut-your-own CSA that starts in July and runs through the end of September, as well as a 6-week Dahlia subscription. More information as the season unfolds.
