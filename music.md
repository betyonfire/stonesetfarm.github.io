Nathan plays music. He plays banjo, guitar, fiddle, and sings with a local
choral group called the Misty Mountain Singers. He also gives banjo lessons.
Call him up if you want to play old time Appalachian string band music, sing
songs, or have a really weird drone noise project that you wouldn't mind him
playing along with.
